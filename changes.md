# Changes Summary

## 1. Local Repository Support
- Added a toggle bar in the UI to switch between 'Remote' and 'Local' repository modes.
- For 'Local' mode, the input field label changes to 'Local Repository Path' and accepts a server-accessible path.
- Removed the misleading 'Browse' button for local repositories, as it is not functional for server-side repo access.
- The form now always displays a 'Confirm' (submit) button for both modes.
- The form submission logic was updated to handle local paths and remote URLs appropriately.

## 2. UI/UX Improvements
- The submit/confirm button is always visible and functional, regardless of the selected mode.
- The user can enter a local path or a remote URL and submit it directly.
- The UI is consistent and clear for both repository modes.
- Error messages and feedback are improved for invalid input.

## 3. Backend/Integration Changes
- The backend API was updated to recognize and process local repository paths (paths accessible to the backend server).
- The repository type detection logic was improved to distinguish between remote URLs and local paths.
- The backend now validates and processes local repositories using the existing infrastructure.

## 4. Removed/Clarified Features
- The 'Browse' button for local repositories was removed to avoid confusion, as it only works for client-side file reading and not for backend repo analysis.

## 5. General
- All changes ensure that the workflow for both remote and local repositories is clear, functional, and user-friendly.
- The system now supports both remote (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and local repositories for wiki generation.
